Segment timer

(c) Mark K Cowan, mark@battlesnake.co.uk

Compile with Delphi / Freepascal / Lazarus on WINDOWS

Alerts you at fixed intervals.

To aid with time management and multitasking, some people (strangely, arty types)
like to take a very computer-science approach to their work, by timeslicing the day
into fixed chunks and working on a different project in each chunk, much like a
typical multi-tasking operating system.  The main difference is that they generally
refuse to work on the same task in two consecutive timeslices.

Notification types:
  * Flash scroll-lock
  * Annoying beep
  * Shaking dialog

Optional command line / shortcut parameters (e.g. in yout Startup folder):
  Segtimer.exe <slice> <notifications>
    * <slice> = time in minutes before alerst
    * notifications = subset of letters from "FBP", with no spaces between
      - F = flashing scroll-lock
      - B = beep
      - P = popup
  e.g. my Segtimer shortcut in Startup uses the following command line:
  	Segtimer.exe 40 FB

Tray-icon commands:
  * Left-double-click  = Restart the timer
  * Right-double-click = Quit segtimer
  * Middle-click       = Show configuration dialog (allows you to change interval & notifications)
